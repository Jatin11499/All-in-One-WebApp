# npm-randomfacts
The GitHub repo for my fun-facts npm package

# How to use
First, you do the obvious, `npm i fun-facts` in terminal then `const facts = require('randomfacts');`  
Next, you run the fact function: `facts.get(options)`  
Now the options bit is detailed in the next section. It can be run without any options, just leave it blank (`facts.get()`).  
The get function returns a fact as an object: `{ type: "success", fact: "example fact", desc: "extra details about example fact" }`  
If there's an error, it returns an error obj like this: `{ type: "error", msg: "you did something wrong mate" }`  
Note: The description may be blank since there are no extra details about the fact, read about the `useDesc` option below to avoid errors involving this.

# Options
The options argument is an object, here's an example of how you might set it:
```js
{
    category : "all",
    maxLength : 0,
    maxDLength : 0,
    useDesc: 0,
    safe : false
}
```
###Category:
What category to choose a fact from, leave it blank for all or type a category (detailed in the Categories section)  

###Max Length:
Max length of the fact  

###Max D Length:
Max description length of the fact  

###Use Desc:
If 0, it will give a description unless description is blank (then it will not add a "desc" property)  
If 1, it will give no description (the object does not have a "desc" property)  
If 2, it will always give a fact that has a description (doesn't work yet)

###Safe:
Safe output, currently doesn't do anything.
